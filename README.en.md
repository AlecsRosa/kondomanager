---

## Guided Installation (Recommended for less experienced users)

For less experienced users or for quick installations on shared hosting (cPanel, Plesk, etc.), we have created an automated wizard.

### 1. New Guided Installation

1. Download the [installation file](https://kondomanager.short.gy/km-installer) from the official Kondomanager website
2. Extract and upload the `index.php` file to the **root** of your server (via FTP or File Manager on cPanel).
3. Open your browser at: `https://yoursite.com/index.php`.
4. Follow the on-screen guided procedure.

For more details, visit the [official installation guide](https://www.kondomanager.com/docs/installation.html) or our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Kondomanager)

### 2. Automatic Update from Administrator Panel

The automatic update system automatically manages the update lifecycle, ensuring data security with just a few clicks directly from the administration panel.

**Warning:** If you don't configure `CronJob` processes, automatic updates will not work.

**How to Configure CronJob**

Access your hosting panel (cPanel, Plesk) in the "Cron Jobs" or "Task Scheduler" section. Set execution every minute (* * * * *).

**Example for MAMP local environment (Mac):**
```bash
/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php8.2.0/bin/php yourfolder/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```
**Example for Shared Server (cPanel/Linux):**
```bash
/usr/local/bin/php /home/yoursite/public_html/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

Make sure to use the absolute path to the PHP v8.2+ executable, for example
/usr/local/bin/ea-php82 /home/yoursite/domain_path/path/to/cron/script 

In the previous example, replace "ea-php99" with the PHP version assigned to the domain you want to use. Check in MultiPHP Manager for the PHP version actually assigned to a domain.

### 3. Update from Version 1.7.0 to 1.8.0

Automatic updates are available starting from version 1.8.0, so if you are still using version 1.7.0 and want to update, you must follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a backup of the `database` and files in the `storage` folder
2. Download the [update file](https://kondomanager.short.gy/km-installer) from the official Kondomanager website
3. Upload the `index.php` file to the root of your server
4. Open your browser at: `https://yoursite.com/index.php`.
5. The system will automatically detect the previously installed version.
6. Click on **"Update now"** and follow the guided steps.

**What the system does automatically:**

- Automatic backup of the `.env` file.
- Download and installation of new core files.
- Restoration of data and configurations.
- Execution of database migrations.
- Cache cleanup and optimization.

**Important:** Do not close the browser page during the update process. The `index.php` file will self-delete at the end of the operation for security.

## Manual Installation (For developers and advanced users)

If you want to contribute to the code or have full SSH access to the server.

### First Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vince844/kondomanager-free.git
cd kondomanager-free
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
composer install
npm install
```

3. **Configure the environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Edit the `.env` file by entering your database parameters (`DB_HOST`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`).

4. **Database Setup**
```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

5. **Start**
```bash
npm run dev
php artisan serve
```

Visit http://localhost:8000.

**Default Credentials:** `admin@km.com` / `password` (Remember to change them immediately by going to your profile `/settings/profile`).

---

### Manual Update (via SSH/Terminal)

If you prefer to update manually, strictly follow these steps to ensure compatibility with the versioning system:

1. **Database Backup (Recommended)**
```bash
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

2. **Update code and dependencies**
```bash
git pull origin main
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
npm install && npm run build
```

3. **CRITICAL STEP**

It is essential to clear the configuration cache before migrating, especially for the new versioning settings system:
```bash
php artisan config:clear
```

4. **Migration and optimization**
```bash
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan storage:link
```

5. **Configuration and Starting Queues** 

The system uses the database driver by default (you can also use Redis if you prefer) to manage background processes. It is necessary to start the worker to process queued tasks.
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```
**Note:** In production environment, it is recommended to configure Supervisor to keep the process running.

### Verify Installed Version

You can verify the current version and the functioning of configurations via Tinker:
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> config('app.version')
```
